#Ensure Your Feature Branch is Up To Date (Optional but recommended)

#Switch to your feature branch if you are not on it:

bash
git checkout feature-branch

#Pull the latest changes from the remote:

bash
git pull

#Switch to the Master Branch

bash
git checkout master

#Update the Master Branch. Make sure your master branch is up to date with the remote repository:

bash
git pull origin master

#Merge Your Feature Branch into Master

bash
git merge feature-branch


#Resolve any conflicts if they arise.

#Push the Updated Master Branch to the Remote Repository

bash
git push origin master


#Optional: Clean Up Feature Branch
#If you no longer need the feature branch, delete it locally:

bash
git branch -d feature-branch
And delete it from remote if desired:

bash
git push origin --delete feature-branch
